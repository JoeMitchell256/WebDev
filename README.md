# WebDev
Website for Visualizing Fourier Coefficients for Professor Bill Leonard

This website will not only be used to demonstrate the visualization of fourier coefficients
but also as a means to demonstrate all of the useful lessons I have learned from Prof. Leonard
during his Matlab/Excel course I took with him in 2019.

The notion of robustness is cruicial in order to design a well organized application of any kind.
This is not limited to Web development or Matlab/Excel but goes for all programming languages alike.

By the completion of this website it should be fully robust in the way that values are entered by
the user. Already to some extent this website experesses robust practices, there is still much more
to implement in terms of robust software design.
